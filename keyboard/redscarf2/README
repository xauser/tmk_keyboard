This board uses a lufa printer bootloader

You have to install a "Generic Text Only" printer in cups

To enter bootloader press ESC + F1 while plugging in usb cable.
After you've entered the bootloader CAPS and BACKSPACE leds start to blink.

The firmware can get flashed via command "cat redscarf2_lufa.hex | lpr -P Generic__Text_Only"
While the firmware gets flashed the bootloader leds start to blink more frequently
